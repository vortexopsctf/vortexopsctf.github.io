We're proud to share our results from our first CTF competition - v1t CTF 2025! This was an incredible learning experience for our team.

We successfully solved multiple challenges across various categories, with our standout achievement being the "Tryna crack?" forensics challenge. This multi-layered puzzle involved ZIP plaintext attacks, PNG metadata extraction, dimension manipulation, and steganography.

Check out our detailed writeup to learn about our approach and methodology!
